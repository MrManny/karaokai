## Q4/2023 ‚úîÔ∏è

  - UX. Oh dear Gods, the UX! It's a bit of a nightmare right now.
  - Guided and/or more semi-automated slide creation. Ideally, I just push a button, tell it I want to karaoke, and it does *brrrrrr.*
    And yes, I have a way with words. Don't @ me.

## Q1/2024

  - Export to a PowerPoint-compatible format.
  - Better Slide Editor.
