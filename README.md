# KaraokAI

Welcome to KaraokAI – Your Ultimate PowerPoint Karaoke Companion!

## Why KaraokAI?

Ever found yourself fumbling through a PowerPoint presentation, wishing it was more fun?
Say hello to KaraokAI, where the art of impromptu speaking meets the hilarity of randomness, powered by the magic of ChatGPT and DALL-E!

## Features

- **Randomized Slides:**
  Get ready for a wild ride! Our app generates the most unexpected, bizarre, and absolutely hilarious slides, ensuring no two presentations are ever the same.
- **ChatGPT Integration:**
  Need some quick witty text for your slides?
  ChatGPT is at your service, spinning words faster than a rapper on double espresso.
- **DALL-E's Artistry:**
  Who needs stock photos when you have DALL-E?
  Get custom images that are as unique as your presentation style – from flying pigs to dancing robots!
  (Flying dancing pig robots are also possible. Don't ask me how I know.)
- **Plan B:**
  You ran out of your OpenAI budget already?
  You probably partied too hard and long last night with KaraokAI.
  No worries, you can still create stuff.
  I am just afraid you might have to use your.. *gasp..* imagination!
